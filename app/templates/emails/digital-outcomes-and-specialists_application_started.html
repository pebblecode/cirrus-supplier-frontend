    Dear supplier,
    <br /><br />
    You, or one of your colleagues, has started an application for the Digital Outcomes and Specialists framework. All contributors on your Digital Marketplace account will now receive email updates.
    <br /><br />
    You need to confirm that you’re eligible to offer services under Digital Outcomes and Specialists as part of the application. You don’t need to describe your services now. You’ll be asked to provide more details when you respond to a buyer’s specific brief.
    <br /><br />
